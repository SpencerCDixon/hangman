# Player is shown the number of letters in the word but they remain masked until the letter is guessed correctly.

# When the player guesses if right, reveal letter, if wrong, decrease number of chances by 1.
# If a player has already guessed a letter, the number of chances is not decremented


#As a player
#I want to know how much of the word I've guessed
#So that I know how much remains
#Make sure to display Chances Remaning: #ofchances

#As a gamemaster
#I want to prompt the user for input
#So that we can continue the game

# Players have a limited number of guesses before losing.


# Create a word bank (array) that chooses a word at random.



#As a gamemaster
#I want to choose a word at random
#So that the game isn't predictable
